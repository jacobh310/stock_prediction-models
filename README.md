# Machine Learning model building for Stock Price Predictions  
---
### Overview   
In this repo I am going to be building stock prediction models for a variety of machine learning algorithms. Each direcetory 
is going to focus on a seperate ML algorithim. Each direcotry will have a README.md summarizing the findings along with a requirements.txt file 
with the required dependencies
